# RotatingMagneticFieldSimulator

NOTES: my spoherical coordinate system IS set up correctly. with the red arrow being the axis of rotation

the diagram direction arrow may not be correct for some axis...\



but the magnetic vector field does not always follow the axis of rotation for certain gammas and alphas

right hand rule only works for one axis

wanything in the y direction seems to be working well

x -- right hand rule is flipped....    think i got it-----> the entire Iy expression needs to be negative.

but this flips the Y right hand rule...
