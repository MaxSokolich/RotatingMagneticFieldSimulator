# RotatingMagneticFieldSimulator
the simulator takes generates the current inputs Ix, Iy,Iz to the 3 axis helmholtz coils, then outputs the correct Bfield using the equations from this website: https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Electricity_and_Magnetism/Electricity_and_Magnetism_(Tatum)/06%3A_The_Magnetic_Effect_of_an_Electric_Current/6.07%3A_Helmholtz_Coils

I have functions to genreate the magnetic field based on each of our coils and there attributes (number of turns, radius, distance etc) b

spoherical coordinate system is set up correctly. with the red arrow being the axis of rotation
